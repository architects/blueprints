# Skypager.io

Skypager allows us to launch fully-custom dynamic websites in under a minute: everything from domain
name registration and DNS configuration to an Amazon Cloudfront powered
site with custom SSL. Best of all, these highly dynamic websites can be
managed by non-technical folk with no servers, backends, or CMS
software.  As changes occur in places like Dropbox, Google Drive, or
elsewhere, the sites are automatically updated with no technical
intervention.
