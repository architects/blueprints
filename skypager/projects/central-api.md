The Central API is the main repository for accounts, site configuration,
access rules and security.  The Central API acts as a gateway for all of
the webhook notifications received from 3rd party services.

The Central API is responsible for provisioning build servers, setting
them up with the necessary site configuration and project files, and
running the build commands on demand as necessary.
