# Project Lead

The Project Lead is usually a design and development generalist, who can
act as an interface between the Product Owner and/or Business Stakeholders and the rest of the design and development team.

They are responsible for ensuring adherence to the design, scope, and
requirements, as well as the best practices.  

The Blueprint's role as a central repository for all relevant knowledge,
as well as an official release plan is valuable to the Project Lead.  In
addition, many of the code review, and other deliverable review and
acceptance process are facilitated by the blueprint.
