organizations activities around the release of the project.  They are
responsible for ensuring the project is done in an appropriate
timeframe, and with the appropriate budget.  

They are also accountable

designing somethign which meets the business goals.

The Blueprint serves as a real-time status dashboard which presents the
targeted plan, and monitors the real state of things to warn when it may
go off track.
