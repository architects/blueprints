# Software Architect

The Architect is responsible for defining, documenting, and
communicating the software architecture and its components.  This includes the system
itself, as well as the project for building it. 

The Blueprint is primarily a tool for communicating the necessary
information about the software architecture, in a way which links to the
work product of the other members of the design and development team who
are contributing.
