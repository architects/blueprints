# Developer

Developers rely on the Blueprint as a project management and
requirements gathering tool, an agile release planner and estimation
tool, as well as a tool for communicating feedback about the many ways the original design
intent or requirements are unrealistic given the many constraints that developers will discover in implementation.

Every developer has experienced the moment when they discover a
fundamental new insight that makes the option of starting over more
expedient and attractive than continuing with the current set of
assumptions, the legacy constraints, and technical debt.

Software architecture, and specifically the many processes which go into
authoring the Blueprint, rely on developer input and participation, and
as a result, are able to simulate the kinds of experiences and realizations that reveal 
invalid assumptions that may be hidden in the foundation of the project.
