# UX Designer

The UX Designer is in charge of the user's satisfaction from their
interaction with the product. This will include detailed input on the
visual design, information architecture, interaction design, and
usability. 

All of this is of central importance to the overall architecture of a
software solution, and the input of a trained User Experience
professional needs to be evident in the finished product.

A UX Designer's contributions to the Blueprint will primarily be in the
form of User Persona descriptions, in the authoring of User Stories, and
in the annotation of Wireframes and clickable prototypes, content and
visual style guides, Sitemaps, and more.
