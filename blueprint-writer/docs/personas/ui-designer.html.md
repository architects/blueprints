# UI Designer

The UI designer works closely with the UX designer, the Front End
Developer, and the Architect.  They are responsible for designing
appropriate user interfaces for the medium and device that the software
will be deployed to (web, mobile, mobile-web, desktop, etc.) 

The Blueprint is a place where the UI designer can contribute sitemaps,
interface mockups, prototypes, and high-fidelity component examples
along with the user interface code required to recreate them as
developers begin to compose the user interface from front end
components.
