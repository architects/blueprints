# Front-end Developer

The front-end developer is in charge of the implementation of the user facing aspects of a software product.  It is very important that the intent for how a product is to behave and look survives implementation, and for that to happen both the designer and developer need to be in sync.  The designer needs to make appropriate design decisions for the medium, and the developer needs to identify the tradeoffs they inevitably need to make in implementation.

The blueprint facilitates this communication and helps priortize the
focus.
