# Integrations

Where the Blueprint begins to differentiate itself from other
traditional functional specification documents, is in how it keeps
itself up to date with the development of the product.

This is accomplished through tight integrations with various services
and tools used in production.

These include but are not limited to:

- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- Github
- Codeship / TravisCI / CircleCI / Jenkins
- Heroku
- Static Analysis / Code Quality Reporting Services
