# Developer Experience

The developer will be working against the blueprint to bring the design
to life.  The developer's experience while doing so will require a high
degree of communication.

Developers not only inform everyone on the status of things, but elevate certain discoveries made during implementation which may
invalidate some of the design assumptions.

Developers are required to estimate user stories, and to track time
spent not just for invoicing and billing purposes, but also to help
refine estimates or adjust prioritization when tasks are estimated
inaccurately.
