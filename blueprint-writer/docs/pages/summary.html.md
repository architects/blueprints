# Summary

The Blueprint by Architects.io is a functional specifications and
requirements document that joins together various materials produced by 
Software Architects, Domain Modelers, Researchers, UX and UI Designers,
Engineers, and Product Managers.  The overall purpose is to communicate
design intent, vision, and goals, along with the strategy and logistics of 
implementation.

Our aim is to reduce the overall communication effort required to
deliver products whose results more closely match the intent and goals.
This requires more effective communication tools, a more effortless
feedback loop, and a methodology for validating and refining the goals themselves as 
everyone's understanding develops. 

The Blueprint is delivered in either PDF form or as a live, interactive web
application which is integrated with the development, testing, and
production environments of the software as it is actively being designed
and developed.

## Why is it valuable?

The overall structure of the Blueprint contains a broad enough set of
documents, diagrams, and other materials which require the active involvement
of software designers, developers, and other stakeholders to fully
complete.  This ends up providing a framework and set of guidelines
which encourage solid design thinking and practices, which accelerate the
overall development of the body of domain knowledge and in-depth understanding 
of the user and their environment, with all of its complexity, that teams naturally 
develop over time.  

Once a Blueprint is completed, a software project now has a a central location for for 
all domain knowledge, a repository for the latest versions of the various assets that will be 
used in the product, and a metrics dashboard which will display various measures for success
or failure that ought to be governing the design and development itself.

## What is the business case?

The Blueprint ensures that the correct product for the end-user is delivered
in a timely manner, within a prescribed budget, and that the overall
product accurately reflects to the architectural vision.

Given that the schedule and sequencing of the software release happens
in stages, and the stages themselves are related to the technological
architecture, the Blueprint contains a release plan with milestones, and
individual feature specifications supported by wireframes, mockups,
prototypes, and other materials.

In our experience using the Blueprint as our official scope for a project, we have found that it contains enough
specificity to serve as an enforceable legal scope of work and contract which governs
things like payment terms. 

Combined with customer acceptance testing processes, the Blueprint can be the basis for a fair agreement that protects the interests of everyone involved.  

From the perspective of the group managing the project and its
implementation, the individual tasks are not only effective descriptions
of what is to be designed and built, but given the tight integration with
the natural workflows of designers, developers, and testers, are capable
of automated status tracking and reporting.

## Why 

One of the key reasons it works is that the process for authoring
the document ends up simulating the kinds of activities which yield
discoveries and insights that normally lead to fundamental rethinking of
the mental models and assumptions that go into the design of the
software.

Rather than having these insights and revelations occur as much of the
framework, scaffolding, and other elements have been already developed,
the design process brings them to the surface earlier.  

In the development of any complex system of knowledge, the first signs
of confidence that we have finally "got it" are dangerous.  This
confidence occurs when you are not yet aware of how much you do not
know. This is what is known as the Dunning Kruger effect. 

Unfortunately, it is when this confidence emerges, that people
begin making estimates, commitments, budgets, plans, and dangerously,
even contracts.

The Blueprint design methodology helps ensure that the estimates and
plans that are made around the software, are made with a firm
understanding of the underlying domain and all of its hidden
complexities, which greatly increases the odds they will be correct.

## Current State

The Blueprint document specification is currently under development.

Architects.io, Inc. has several engagements with clients who have
contracted us to develop these documents for software design and
development projects that they have planned for launch in late 2015.

In its current form, it is a Middleman application which renders a large
collection of categorized markdown documents into a website. The reason
we use Markdown is that it is an easy text file format, with minimal
structure, that anyone can use to contribute to the document.

The generated website contains and interactive display of various documents such as the visual design mockups produced by our UI designer, PDF wireframes produced by a UX Designer we collaborate with, and domain model diagrams produced by our Software Architect. In addition to this, various research documents, customer interviews, relevant websites, and other reference material are organized and presented in way that lets everyone involved in the project gather the necessary domain knowledge needed to participate in the ongoing design and development.
